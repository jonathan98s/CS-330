How do I approach designing software?
Reviewing the matieral prior to going in blindly and start working. Having a strong background of what you are creating will open your eyes into the project more. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
New designs I have learned was creating different shapes, textures, and lighting. Taking the time on each design skill went a long way in my work. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Gathering/researching the provided material helped me prepare what assignment I was working on for the week. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The things I have learned in this class will carry on into future work if needed. I will always have this handy in my back pocket. OpenGL is new to me and this class has taught me so much during the weeks.

How do I approach developing programs?
As mentioned, reviewing the material and having an idea on what you want to craft will create what you need.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The provided matieral and always the youtube videos for reference helped me develope my 3D scenes.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Working on each section at a time rather than all at once helped. It allowed me to take my time and no rush the final product. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science as a whole has many different pathways you can go into. Overall it helps me learn more about programming and peaking my interest in certain pathways I can take.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
In the future if I ever need to develope something that requires 3D scenes using OpenGL I will now know how.
